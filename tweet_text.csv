Thanks for pointing it out. Taking a look into this now."
Positive,Neutral,"There‚Äôs no questionnaire about symptoms, no requirement to report to the House physician if we are experiencing symptoms, no temperature check upon arrival to DC, nothing.

Positive,Negative,"The HEROES Act the House passed months ago covers several (but not all) of these points.
